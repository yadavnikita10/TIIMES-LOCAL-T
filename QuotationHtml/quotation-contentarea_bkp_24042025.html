                    <strong>I. Definitions</strong><br>
                    <!--TUV India Private Limited (referred as TUV India) established in India in August 1989 provides
                    expert services, including inspection services, in the areas as defined in the Memorandum of
                    Association of the Company.-->
                    The following terms used in these General Terms and Conditions have the following meaning:
                    "TUVI" is the company of the TÜV NORD GROUP, in which name this Agreement is being signed.
                    "Customer" is the Company, Sole Proprietary firm, Entrepreneur or any other entity who is issuing the order on TUVI.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 8.5px; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>II. Validity of these Conditions</strong><br>
                    1. Except as provided otherwise in individual cases, Agreements with the TUVI are concluded exclusively pursuant to the following provisions. The TUVI does not accept any of the Customers conflicting regulations or conditions to the contrary
                    unless it expressly consented to such in writing. The TUVI's following conditions apply even if the TUVI provides its service without reservations while knowing of the customer's contradicting or conflicting conditions.<br>
                    2. These General Terms and Conditions apply to all of the TUVI’s services (to include but not limited to Certification, inspection and testing services) and all responsibilities resulting from the contractual obligation with the customer's. These conditions also apply to all future business relations vis-a-vis companies and corporate bodies governed by public law.<br>
                    3. In the event of any conflict between these terms and conditions and any document purporting to impose different terms, these terms and conditions will prevail.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 8.5px; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>III. Conclusion of the Contract</strong><br>
                    1. An Agreement is deemed to be concluded with the TUVI only after the Customer accepts an offer by the TUVI without reservations or if the Customer receives a written order confirmation from the TUVI or if the TUVI commences the provision of the service. If the TUVI issues a written order confirmation, such order confirmation is decisive in terms of content and scope of the Agreement unless expressly negotiated otherwise.<br>
                    2. Any and all arrangements between the Customer and TUVI regarding the performance of the Agreement are fully set forth in writing in this Agreement including these General Terms and Conditions. There are no verbal supplements<br>
                    3. Amendments, collateral agreements and additional provisions as well as any respective warranty of quality shall require our written confirmation in order to become effective. <br>
                    4. All statements and communications which form part of the contractual and business relationship shall be declared in writing, by email or in any electronic or physical form, unless otherwise expressly defined under these terms and conditions.<br>
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 8.5px; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>IV. Performance of the Agreement and Customer's Obligation to Participate</strong><br>
                    1. If objects of the Customer must be accessed for the contractual performance of the service owed by the TUVI, the TUVI shall not be liable for compensation for damage to or destruction of these objects resulting from the contractual performance.
                    <br />2. If the TUVI's own equipment is damaged, destroyed, or lost as a consequence or at the occasion of proper performance of the TUVI's service and through no fault of the TUVI, the TUVI is authorized to request replacement from the Customer.
                    <br />3. Transportation and possible return of the Customer's objects is at its own cost and risk; however, return is performed only upon the Customer's express request. During storage, the TUVI's liability is limited to the same due diligence as for its own affairs.
                    <br />4. The Customer is obligated to fully disclose all information relevant for the TUVI’s proper performance of its service. The TUVI, is however not obligated to review the accuracy and completeness of data, information, or other services provided by the Customer, in so far as there is no cause for this in consideration of the respective circumstances of each individual case, unless expressly stated within the order. The TUVI does not accept any warranties for the accuracy of safety rules, information and programs upon which its inspections and expert opinions are based, unless such regulations, instructions, or programs originate with him or are the object of the inspection order.  If the TUVI is commissioned with inspecting the technical safety of an object, it does not accept any warranties for the object's freedom from other faults, unless this is expressly listed in the order.
                    <br />5. In so far as the Customer's participation is required for the TUVI's performance of services, the Customer must provide such in a timely manner and at its own costs; expenses will be reimbursed only if this has been negotiated expressly in text form. To the extent that the Customer does not fulfill its obligations to participate, does not do so properly or in a timely manner, and if acceptance is therefore delayed, the TUVI is authorized to charge any additional expenses thus incurred. The TUVI's further legal claims are expressly not affected.
                    <br />6. The TUVI is authorized to have the services owed under this Agreement performed by a carefully selected and suitable subcontractor.
                    <br />7. If the TUVI is active outside of its premises, the Customer shall be responsible for any measures required in order to fulfill duties of care to safeguard public, unless such is not required based on the nature of the activity or based on an agreement with the Customer. The TUVI is authorized to refuse performance of the service for as long as required measures are not taken. The Customer will inform the TUVI in writing, in a timely manner, of all safety and accident prevention regulations applicable at the location.
                    <br />8. If the Agreement includes services pertaining to the Customer's Information Security system, the Customer is obligated to back up data and programs at regular intervals that are adequate for the application, at least once a day, in machine-readable form, to ensure that these can be recovered with reasonable effort. The TUVI is not responsible for loss of any data during the performance of services.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 8.4px; text-align: justify;">
                    9. In addition to above, the customer shall ensure that all the necessary assistance on his part or on the part of persons he engages to help in performance of the contract shall be provided in good time and at no expense to TUVI. Such assistance shall include, but not be limited to, access to documented inspection history, safe site access, timely availability of key interface, preparation of items for inspection in good time, permission to carry out necessary audit, inspection or testing on TUVI as part of accreditation and approval process by regulatory, certification & accreditation bodies if & when required. Such assistance must be in accordance with relevant applicable standards, safety provisions and accident prevention regulations. The customer or the persons/parties he/she engages shall ensure restriction of access to the inspected items and the equipment/facilities used for inspection by unauthorized persons. In case of doubt TUVI shall have the right to confirm the continuing suitability for the intended purpose of the inspected items and the equipment/ facilities used for inspection by means of visual inspection, functional checks, additional tests if required, verification of records and/or recalibration of the equipment/facility.

                    The customer shall be liable for the extra expense entailed by late or improper assistance on his part.  TUVI shall be entitled to charge for this extra expense in addition even if a fixed or maximum price has been agreed. In the same way, the customer shall bear any expenses incurred owing to the fact that work has to be repeated or is delayed because of his late, incorrect or incomplete information or if the inspection cannot be accomplished due to adverse weather conditions or vendor related factors.
                    The customer or the persons/parties he/she engages shall take responsibility to provide a safe place of work for TUVI’s employees.

                    <strong>V. Deadlines and Schedules</strong><br>
                    1.  If a binding deadline for the provision of services is not agreed, the TUVI defaults only if the Customer has first given an adequate deadline in text form to provide the service owed and such deadline has expired unsuccessfully. Deadlines commence only as of the complete provision of any and all obligations to participate owed by the Customer, and, in so far as a payment has been negotiated, as of the receipt of such. Deadlines are extended accordingly due to the Customer's retroactive change requests or delayed participation.
                    <br />2. If the service owed by the TUVI is delayed due to unforeseeable circumstances and through circumstances, for which the TUVI is not at fault (e.g. strike, legitimate lockout, disruption of operation, transportation disruption, shortage of resources, official measures - also at the TUVI's supplier), the TUVI is authorized to defer the service for the duration of the delay. In the event that the delay lasts more than six weeks or maximum limit defined under accreditation, the TUVI is authorized to withdraw from the Agreement. The TUVI will immediately inform the Customer of the non-availability of the service or partial service, and in the event of a withdrawal from the Agreement will immediately reimburse any services in return already provided for such. Claims for damages are excluded. Also refer Section XI Force Majeure.
                    <br />3. If the Customer defaults on acceptance or if it violates other obligations to participate, the TUVI is authorized to request reimbursement of any additional expenses possibly incurred due to such default or violation. This does not affect any further legal claims for damages.

                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 8.5px; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>VI. Acceptance</strong><br>
                    1. The Customer is obligated to accept the TUVI's services. Insignificant defects do not entitle the Customer to refuse acceptance. In case of separable partial services, the TUVI is also authorized to request partial acceptance unless specific provision of accreditation is applicable
                    <br />2. The Customer is obligated to accept the TUVI's services within 14 days after completion and TUVI’s request for acceptance, unless the Customer refuses acceptance within the fixed grace period by specification of at least one defect. If the Customer does not accept the services within the fixed grace period even though it is obligated to do so, the service is deemed to be accepted. If the Customer is a Consumer, the TUVI along with its request for acceptance is obliged to expressly inform the Customer of the consequences of not declaring the acceptance or refusing acceptance without specification of defects.
                    <br />3. If the Customer claims a retention right due to defects in service delivery, the TUVI shall review its service. If the Customer's retention is proven to be unjustified, the Customer shall bear all incurred additional costs unless it has acted merely with slight negligence or is not at fault.
                    <br />4. Intellectual performances shall be deemed as accepted, unless the customer expresses reservations in writing within 14 days after significance of his behaviour when the period of notice begins. In this case we will check our performance. Should our performance prove to be without fault the customer shall bear the additional cost, unless he has only committed an act of minor negligence.

                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 8.5px; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>VII. Prices and Payments</strong><br>
                    1. The price listed by the TUVI or otherwise the price commonly charged by the TUVI for the respective service is decisive, plus statutory taxes in so far as such is applicable. Any bank charges or financial institutional charges for remitting the payment due to TUVI will be responsibility of Customer and TUVI will not accept any such charges deducted from the remittance.
                    <br />2. If, within the scope of contracts for the performance of a continuing obligation and long-term contracts, the TUVI's prime costs increase and such increase is not within the TUVI's own scope of responsibility, the TUVI is authorized to an appropriate price increase commensurate with the increase of its prime costs; if the Customer does not consent to such price increase it is authorized to terminate the Agreement within four weeks after receipt of such notification of a price increase; otherwise, the increase is deemed to be mutually agreed upon. A right to a price increase pursuant to this provision does not exist if the Customer is a Consumer.
                    <br />3.  The Customer shall pay the remuneration owed without any discounts, free of charge to the TUVI, and within seven days after receipt of the invoice, to the bank account stated by the TUVI.  Credit entry at the TUVI's account is decisive for the timeliness of the payment. The TUVI reserves the right to request appropriate advance payments.
                    <br />4. If the Agreement is based on a cost estimate, and if it turns out that the costs will be significantly higher than the amount estimated vis-a-vis the Customer, then the TUVI will inform the Customer of such in text form. In this case the Customer is authorized to terminate the Agreement in writing, within two weeks after receipt of such notification. In the event of a termination, the TUVI is authorized to request partial remuneration commensurate with the services already provided. Furthermore, the TUVI is authorized to request compensation for any expenses not included in the remuneration but incurred due to the provision of services.
                    <br />5. If the Customer owes interest and expenses in addition to a possibly existing Customer claim, any payment by the Customer that does not fully redeem the total sum will first be credited against expenses, secondly against interest, and lastly against the Customer claim.
                    <br />6. The Customer is entitled to offset and retention rights only if its counterclaims are legally ascertained, undisputed, or acknowledged in writing by the TUVI. This limitation does not apply to the Customer's claims for defects arising from the same contractual relation as the TUVI's payment claim. If the contract partner is a Consumer, then in contrast to clause 1, such contract partner is on Customer entitled to unlimited retention rights for claims arising from the same contractual relation.
                    <br />7. If, after conclusion of the Agreement, it becomes clear that the TUVI's claims vis-a-vis the Customer are at risk due to the Customer's lack of ability to perform, the TUVI is authorized to perform outstanding services only against advance payment or provision of a security as well as settlement of possibly still outstanding receivables for partial services already provided and arising from the Agreement, and after unsuccessful expiration of a grace period  is authorized to withdraw from the Agreement;
                    <br />8. In case of payment default, the Customer owes default interest in the amount of 24 percentages. The TUVI is entitled to assert further claims if it can prove higher damage to the Customer.

                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 8.4px; text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>VIII. Claims for Defects</strong><br>
                    1. In the event of defective service by the TUVI, the Customer shall grant the TUVI opportunity to supplementary performance, at least twice, within appropriate grace periods, unless this is unreasonable having received such performance in writing and with a concrete description of individual faults, expresses reservations in writing, whereby we will inform the customer again of the foreseen in each individual case or unless special circumstances justify the Customer's immediate withdrawal in consideration of mutual interests. The TUVI may rectify the defect at its own choice or provide the service once more without defect. If supplementary performance is unsuccessful, the Customer is authorized to reduce remuneration agreed to TUVI or to withdraw from the Agreement. TUVI is nowhere responsible for any consequential damages.

The Customer shall inform the TUVI of any hidden defects in writing no later than within two weeks after discovery. Once this grace period is over, the customer’s rights regarding defects in the services rendered become invalid if there are no contrary legal provisions.

                    The Customers’ right to withdraw is valid only if the TUVI is responsible for the violation of duties based upon which withdrawal is declared.
